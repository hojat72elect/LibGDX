/**
 * Info : This interface was moved to kerman game engine.
 *
 * A LifecycleListener can be added to an [Application] via [Application.addLifecycleListener]. It
 * will receive notification of pause, resume and dispose events. This is mainly meant to be used by extensions that need to
 * manage resources based on the life-cycle. Normal, application level development should rely on the [ApplicationListener]
 * interface.
 *
 * The methods will be invoked on the rendering thread. The methods will be executed before the [ApplicationListener]
 * methods are executed.
