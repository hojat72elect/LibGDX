/**
 * Provides methods to perform networking operations, such as simple HTTP get and post requests, and TCP server/client socket
 * communication.
 *
 * To perform an HTTP request create a [HttpRequest] with the HTTP method (see [HttpMethods] for common methods) and
 * invoke [.sendHttpRequest] with it and a [HttpResponseListener]. After the HTTP
 * request was processed, the [HttpResponseListener] is called with a [HttpResponse] with the HTTP response values and
 * an status code to determine if the request was successful or not.
 *
 * To create a TCP client socket to communicate with a remote TCP server, invoke the
 * [.newClientSocket] method. The returned [Socket] offers an [InputStream]
 * and [OutputStream] to communicate with the end point.
 *
 * To create a TCP server socket that waits for incoming connections, invoke the
 * [.newServerSocket] method. The returned [ServerSocket] offers a
 * [ServerSocket.accept] method that waits for an incoming connection.
