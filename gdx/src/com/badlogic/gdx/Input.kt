/**
 * Interface to the input facilities. This allows polling the state of the keyboard, the touch screen and the accelerometer. On
 * some backends (desktop, etc) the touch screen is replaced by mouse input. The accelerometer is of course not available on
 * all backends.
 * Instead of polling for events, one can process all input events with an [InputProcessor]. You can set the InputProcessor
 * via the [.setInputProcessor] method. It will be called before the [ApplicationListener.render]
 * method in each frame.
 * Keyboard keys are translated to the constants in [Keys] transparently on all systems. Do not use system specific key
 * constants.
 * The class also offers methods to use (and test for the presence of) other input systems like vibration, compass, on-screen
 * keyboards, and cursor capture. Support for simple input dialogs is also provided.
