/**
 * A Preference instance is a hash map holding different values. It is stored alongside your application (SharedPreferences on
 * Android, on the desktop a Java Preferences file in a ".prefs" directory will be created, and on iOS an
 * NSMutableDictionary will be written to the given file). CAUTION: On the desktop platform, all libGDX applications share the
 * same ".prefs" directory. To avoid collisions use specific names like "com.myname.game1.settings" instead of "settings".
 *
 * To persist changes made to a preferences instance [.flush] has to be invoked. With the exception of Android, changes
 * are cached in memory prior to flushing. On iOS changes are not synchronized between different preferences instances.
 *
 * Use [Application.getPreferences] to look up a specific preferences instance. Note that on several backends the
 * preferences name will be used as the filename, so make sure the name is valid for a filename.
